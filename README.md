# Lab Reports Collection

This repository contains a collection of lab reports demonstrating various algorithms and problems implemented using Python. Each notebook covers a specific algorithm or problem, explaining the approach, code, and results. These reports are designed for educational purposes and provide a hands-on implementation of important concepts in computer science and artificial intelligence.

## Lab Reports Included:

1. **Remove Punctuation from String**
   - A Python program that removes all punctuation characters from a given string.
   - Implements the solution using Python's built-in string methods.

2. **Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS)**
   - Implementation of BFS and DFS search algorithms for graph traversal.
   - BFS explores neighbors level by level, while DFS explores as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking.

3. **A* Search Algorithm**
   - Demonstrates the A* algorithm, an informed search technique used for pathfinding and graph traversal.
   - Incorporates heuristics to find the shortest path efficiently.

4. **Hill Climbing Algorithm**
   - Local search algorithm for optimization problems, finding a solution that is locally optimal.
   - Explores neighboring solutions iteratively and selects the best neighbor at each step.

5. **Minimax Algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning**
   - Minimax is used for decision-making in two-player games.
   - Alpha-Beta Pruning is an optimization technique to reduce the number of nodes evaluated by the minimax algorithm.

6. **Water Jug Problem**
   - Solution to the water jug problem using different search algorithms, including A*.
   - Models the problem of measuring exact amounts of water with two jugs.

7. **Remove Punctuation from String**
   - Python program that removes punctuation from a given string and outputs the cleaned text.

8. **Hangman Game**
   - Implementation of the classic Hangman game using Python.
   - Allows a player to guess letters in a hidden word, with a limited number of incorrect guesses.

9. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**
   - A 2-player Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python.
   - Includes a simple AI opponent that uses a basic decision-making algorithm.

10. **Stemming and Lemmatization Using NLTK**
    - Demonstrates text preprocessing techniques such as stemming and lemmatization using NLTK.
    - Reduces words to their base forms for natural language processing tasks.

11. **POS Tagging Using NLTK**
    - Part-of-speech tagging for a given sentence using the NLTK library.
    - Identifies the grammatical structure of each word in a sentence.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: All lab reports and algorithms are implemented using Python.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit used for text processing (stemming, lemmatization, POS tagging).
- **Graph Search Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, A*, Hill Climbing, and Minimax algorithms are implemented in Python.
- **Game Programming**: Hangman and Tic-Tac-Toe games are implemented with basic logic in Python.
