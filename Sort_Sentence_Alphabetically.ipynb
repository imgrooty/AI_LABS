    "1. **`sentence.split()`**:\n",
    "   - This method splits the input sentence into words based on spaces.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **`sorted()`**:\n",
    "   - This function sorts the list of words alphabetically.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **`' '.join()`**:\n",
    "   - This method joins the sorted list of words back into a sentence by adding spaces between the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observations:\n",
    "- For the example where the input sentence is `\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"`:\n",
    "  - The words were sorted alphabetically to form: `\"The brown dog fox jumps lazy over quick the\"`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Example Output:\n",
    "- The sentence without sorting: `\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"`.\n",
    "- The sentence after sorting: `\"The brown dog fox jumps lazy over quick the\"`.\n"
