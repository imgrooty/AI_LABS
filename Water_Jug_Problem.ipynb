    "- Given two jugs of capacity `x` liters and `y` liters, determine the sequence of steps to measure exactly `z` liters.\n",

    "### Approach\n",
    "- Represent the problem as a state space where each state is a tuple `(a, b)`, where `a` and `b` are the amounts of water in the two jugs.\n",
    "- Use BFS to explore all possible states until the target state `(a, b)` is reached, where `a + b = z`.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **State Representation**:\n",
    "   - Each state is represented as a tuple `(jug1, jug2)`, where `jug1` and `jug2` are the current amounts of water in the jugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:\n",
    "   - BFS is used to explore all possible states until the target amount is reached.\n",
    "   - The queue stores the states, and a set tracks visited states to avoid loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **State Transitions**:\n",
    "   - The algorithm considers all possible actions, such as filling, emptying, or pouring between jugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Termination**:\n",
    "   - The algorithm terminates when one of the jugs contains the target amount of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observations\n",
    "- For the example where Jug 1 has a capacity of 4 liters, Jug 2 has a capacity of 3 liters, and the target is 2 liters:\n",
    "  - The solution steps might include sequences like filling, pouring, and emptying the jugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Output\n",
    "- The solution steps for the given input are:\n",
    "  - `(0, 0) -> (4, 0) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 0) -> (0, 1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sequence illustrates how the jugs are manipulated to reach the target state.\n"
