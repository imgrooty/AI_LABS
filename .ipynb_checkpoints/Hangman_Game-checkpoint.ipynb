    "This Lab work demonstrates the implementation of the Hangman game in Python.\n",

    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "- Implement a simple Hangman game where the player has to guess a word by suggesting letters within a limited number of guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "- Randomly select a word.\n",
    "- Allow the user to guess one letter at a time.\n",
    "- Display the current state of the word with guessed letters revealed.\n",
    "- Track the number of incorrect guesses.\n",
    "- End the game when the word is guessed or the number of incorrect guesses exceeds a limit.\n"

    "1. **Random Word Selection**:\n",
    "   - A random word is selected from the list of predefined words using `random.choice()`.\n",

    "2. **Game Loop**:\n",
    "   - The player is prompted to guess a letter.\n",
    "   - If the guessed letter is correct, it is revealed in the word.\n",
    "   - If the guessed letter is incorrect, the number of incorrect guesses is incremented.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conditions**:\n",
    "   - The game ends when the word is completely guessed or the player runs out of allowed incorrect guesses.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Input Validation**:\n",
    "   - The program ensures that the user enters a single valid letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observations:\n",
    "- The game is played interactively, with the user guessing letters until they either win or lose.\n",
    "- The number of incorrect guesses is tracked, and the game ends if it exceeds a limit (6 in this case).\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Example Output:\n",
    "- A player might guess a word like `\"python\"` by making guesses such as `\"p\"`, `\"y\"`, etc.\n",
    "- If the player guesses incorrectly more than six times, the game ends, and the word is revealed.\n",
