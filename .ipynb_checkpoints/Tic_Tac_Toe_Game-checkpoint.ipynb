    "This Lab work demonstrates the implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "- Implement a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players take turns to mark a 3x3 grid with 'X' and 'O'.\n",
    "- The game ends when one player gets three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or if the grid is full (draw).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "- Create a 3x3 grid to represent the game board.\n",
    "- Alternate turns between Player 1 ('X') and Player 2 ('O').\n",
    "- After each turn, check if there's a winner or if the game is a draw.\n",
    "- Display the board after each turn and the final result.\n"

    "1. **`print_board()`**:\n",
    "   - This function prints the Tic-Tac-Toe board after every move, showing the current state of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`check_winner()`**:\n",
    "   - This function checks if the given player has won by checking all rows, columns, and diagonals.\n",

    "3. **`is_board_full()`**:\n",
    "   - This function checks if the board is full, which indicates a draw if no player has won.\n",

    "4. **`tic_tac_toe()`**:\n",
    "   - This function controls the game loop, alternating turns between Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O).\n",
    "   - It ensures the game continues until thereï¿½s a winner or a draw.\n",

    "## Observations:\n",
    "- The game alternates turns between Player 1 ('X') and Player 2 ('O').\n",
    "- The game checks for a winner after each move and displays the current state of the board.\n",
    "- The game ends either when a player wins or when the board is full (draw).\n",
