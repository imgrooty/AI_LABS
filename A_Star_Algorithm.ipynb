    "## Explanation of Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph Representation**:\n",
    "   - The graph is represented as a dictionary of dictionaries.\n",
    "   - The outer dictionary maps each node to its neighbors, and the inner dictionary contains the edge costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Heuristic Function**:\n",
    "   - The heuristic function provides an estimate of the cost from any node to the goal node.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Priority Queue**:\n",
    "   - A priority queue is used to manage the open list, prioritizing nodes with the lowest **f(n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **A* Algorithm Logic**:\n",
    "   - The algorithm computes **f(n) = g(n) + h(n)** for each node, where:\n",
    "     - **g(n)**: Cost from the start node to the current node.\n",
    "     - **h(n)**: Estimated cost from the current node to the goal.\n",
    "   - The algorithm terminates when the goal node is dequeued.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observations\n",
    "- The A* algorithm guarantees the shortest path if the heuristic is admissible (never overestimates the true cost).\n",
    "- It is efficient for finding paths in weighted graphs, especially when the heuristic is well-designed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Output\n",
    "- For the given graph starting at node 'A' with the goal node 'F':\n",
    "  - Path: `['A', 'C', 'F']`\n",
    "  - Total Cost: `10`\n"
