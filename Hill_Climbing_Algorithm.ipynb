    "1. **Heuristic-based Search**: The algorithm uses a heuristic function to evaluate the quality of solutions.\n",

    "3. **Termination**: Stops when a peak (local or global) is reached.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **Objective Function**:\n",
    "   - This function represents the problem to be optimized. \n",
    "   - In this example, the function is \\( f(x) = -(x^2) + 5x + 6 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Neighbors Function**:\n",
    "   - Generates possible solutions by modifying the current solution slightly.\n",
    "   - For a 1D search space, neighbors are defined as \\( x-1 \\) and \\( x+1 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hill Climbing Algorithm**:\n",
    "   - Starts with a randomly selected initial solution.\n",
    "   - Evaluates all neighboring solutions and moves to the one with the highest value.\n",
    "   - Terminates when no better neighbor is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observations\n",
    "- Hill Climbing is prone to getting stuck in local maxima.\n",
    "- It works well when the problem has a single peak (global maximum).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Output\n",
    "- For the given objective function, the algorithm may output:\n",
    "  - Optimal Solution: `2` (if global maximum is reached).\n",
    "  - Objective Value: `11`.\n"
