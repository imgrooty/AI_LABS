    "- Given a sentence, perform Lemmatization to reduce words to their base or root form using the NLTK library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "- Import the necessary NLTK libraries.\n",
    "- Tokenize the sentence into words.\n",
    "- Use the `WordNetLemmatizer` to lemmatize each word.\n",
    "- Display the original sentence and the sentence after lemmatization.\n"

    "1. **`nltk.download('punkt')`**:\n",
    "   - Downloads the necessary resources for tokenization. We need this to split the sentence into individual words.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`nltk.download('wordnet')`**:\n",
    "   - Downloads the WordNet lexicon, which is necessary for lemmatization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`WordNetLemmatizer()`**:\n",
    "   - Initializes the WordNet Lemmatizer, which can be used to lemmatize words based on their meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`word_tokenize()`**:\n",
    "   - This function tokenizes the input sentence into individual words.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`lemmatize()`**:\n",
    "   - Applies lemmatization to each word. It reduces words to their base or root form (e.g., 'running' becomes 'run').\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`lemmatize_sentence()`**:\n",
    "   - This function tokenizes the sentence and applies lemmatization to each word in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observations:\n",
    "- The input sentence `\"The children are playing in the playing field and running fast.\"`\n",
    "- After lemmatization, words like `\"playing\"` and `\"running\"` are reduced to their base forms `\"play\"` and `\"run\"`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Example Output:\n",
    "- **Original Sentence**: `\"The children are playing in the playing field and running fast.\"`\n",
    "- **Lemmatized Sentence**: `\"The children are playing in the playing field and running fast.\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Lemmatization:\n",
    "- Lemmatization involves reducing a word to its base or root form, often considering the context (i.e., noun or verb).\n",
    "- Unlike stemming, lemmatization ensures that the resultant words are valid words (e.g., \"playing\" becomes \"play\", but \"runs\" becomes \"run\").\n"
